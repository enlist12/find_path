# Read me
solve.py is used in ida,for searching modifications that could lead control-flow to target instruction.
It creats paths via idapython,and solve constraints via angr.
CFG.py is version 1.0 of this project,regardless of some problems.
Later,I would show the limits and condtions to use them.
